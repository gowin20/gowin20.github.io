            <br>
            <img src="images/art/the-door-hedrick.png">
            <p>This was my dorm room door during my second year at UCLA. 
                A collaborative effort between me & my roommate Oliver, our goal was to completely fill up the door by the end of the year. 
                Sadly, COVID-19 prevented us from doing so. However, while the door lasted it was a wonderful way to meet new friends! We got 40 or 50 different people to do post-its.</p>

            <img src="images/art/obscureroofs-flyerv2.png" class="smimg">
            <p>A flyer for the subreddit I created, Obscure Roofs! 
                Its purpose is to celebrate cool-looking rooftops, as well as fun explorations onto any roofs</p>

            <h1>Dystopian City</h1> <br>
            <img src="images/art/dystopian-city.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>I'm in the process of designing a city as worldbuilding. I plan to write stories set here, and am currently developing a D&D campaign as well. Thumb for scale! (he tiny)</p>

            <h3>Dystopian Alley</h3>
            <img src="images/art/dystopian-street.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>An alley of the city. This started off as a quick doodle, but I really like it!</p>

            <h3>16 Interlocking Triangles</h3>
            <img src="images/art/16triangles-1.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>A wireframe model made using 48 strips of paper. The model is composed of 16 individual triangles with 3 strips each. 
                To assemble this, I had to weave together individual units in a complicated interlocking pattern.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/art/16triangles-2.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>Alternate view of the weaving pattern. The whole model holds itself together because each triangle pushes against the others. <br> <br>
                To nerd out a little bit more: The model has octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry. This means that the model can be represented as an octahedron, 
                with two tetrahedra inlaid within it. Each point where several triangles intersect (look at the center of the above image) is one vertex of these shapes. It's a little easier to understand in person, I promise!

            <h3>Woven Ball</h3>
            <img src="images/art/woven-ball.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>Uses 12 sheets of paper. This one was INCREDIBLY annoying to make, as the units lock together by curling the edges. 
                No glue was used in the making of this! (or any other one on this page, obviously)</p>

            <img src="images/art/icosahedron.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>Uses 30 strips of paper, folded into simple modules and interwoven. Note how no color touches itself!</p>

            <h3>Icosahedron Kusudama</h3>
            <img src="images/art/fancy-icosahedron.jpg" class="smimg">
            <p>Kusudamas are spherical shapes with cool designs on each face. 
                This one is a platonic solid, meaning each face is identical, and every angle is the same as well. Uses 60 sheets of paper. </p>
