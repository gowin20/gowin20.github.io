<p>This chapter revealed a lot about what's coming next in the story. We got dragon interacting with giants in Ohara, meaning he probably has a connection with Elbaf. That also ties in with Kuma's plotline and his &quot;special race.&quot; I wouldn't be surprised if we met Dragon again on Elbaf very soon...</p>
<p>Skypiea and Skypieans are coming back too. Island Clouds are already back on Egghead, which is definitely a sign that they'll be relevant again soon. They also have obvious ties to Sun God Nika, who we desperately need more information about.</p>
<p>The giant beanstalk from Skypiea has obvious connections to giants. It fits into the theme of Elbaf literally being a fable, just like Jack and the Beanstalk. I believe that Elbaf is a sky island at least in part: a giant tree leading up to a collection of sky islands. The beanstalk then would serve as foreshadowing of this much larger plant in the new world.</p>
<p>Finally, ive always thought that dragon's tattoos look like the tattoos of the Shandoran people, now we learned he obtained them somewhat recently since he didn't have them in this chapter. What if the revolutionary army is also connected to them?</p>
<p>Egghead -&gt; Elbaf -&gt; World War -&gt; Raftel -&gt; Epilogue</p>
<p>We're going to meet the revolutionary army on Elbaf, which fits with Kuma's plotline being introduced now. We just found out that he founded the revolutionary army alongside dragon, and
[2:24 AM]
ELBAF AS AN EVOLUTION OF SKYPIEA
[2:24 AM]
Natural successor like alabaster and dressrossa. Clear Parallels between old and new world
[2:25 AM]
Thriller bark and wano parallels
[2:26 AM]
Parallels between paradise and new world arcs</p>
<p>Elbaf will draw clear parallels to Skypiea</p>
<p>We're going to get elbaf next:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>revolutionary army connections to elbaf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jaguar d saul is still alive and likely the &quot;man marked by flames&quot; mentioned by Kidd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kidd would fit in naturally to a viking setting, and Oda has already mentioned that he has a larger role to play still</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elbaf seems to have a large amount of knowledge, and know how to decipher poneglyphs since they rescued the research of Ohara</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>makes sense that they would have the final road poneglyph. In fact, they probably have a great deal of knowledge: maybe they have the majority of the poneglyphs in the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robin and her backstory being highlighted, would make sense ^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shanks has a large amount of knowledge of the true history, makes sense for him to be allied w the giants</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Elbaf is not going to be a large self-contained arc like Wano. From here on out all conflicts and arcs will take place on a global scale. Luffy is a yonko now after all, and operates on a global scale with his grand fleet and many allies. We need to start thinking of arcs that really play off of that.</p>
<p>Before we get a world war, the government has to do something absolutely inexcusable. We need to find out the secrets of the void century, and understand Imu's backstory as the ruler of the world. All of that needs to happen before we actually go to war; kind of like Kine'mon and the scabbards gave us exposition about Kaido while on Zou.</p>
