<p>Have you ever found it odd just how many different races are present in the world of one piece? I mean, look at them all. We've got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans</li>
<li>Giants</li>
<li>Skypieans</li>
<li>Birkans</li>
<li>Lunarians</li>
<li>Three-eyed tribe</li>
<li>Fishmen</li>
<li>Merfolk</li>
<li>Minks</li>
<li>Longleg people</li>
<li>Longarm people</li>
<li>Tontatta</li>
<li>Whatever race kuma is</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that all of these races were invented by the highly advanced ancient kingdom using bloodline element manipulation, in the same manner as they invented devil fruits.</p>
<p>All of these races still bear strong similarity to regular humans, so I believe they have recieved permenant modifications to their bodies in order to create new races. Fishmen, merfolk, and minks all seem like a cross between humans and animals, similar to someone who has eaten a Zoan devil fruit (connection to Zou?). The other races are even simpler: the three-eyed tribe are just humans with three eyes, and the longleg / longarm tribes are just humans with longer bodies. Giants are just big humans.</p>
<p>Caesar has even created giants using science already in the story, all the way back in Punk Hazard.</p>
<p>In fact, scientific progress being used to shape human bodies has been a major theme in the second half of One Piece, and has been foreshadowed to be extremely important. Nearly every arc has had an important scientist, with Caesar in PH, Judge in WCI, Queen in Wano, and now Vegapunk in Egghead. Each of these scientists has been shown conducting experiments to modify human bodies. Caesar gigantified children, Judge created a clone army, Queen modified his own body, and Vegapunk created Pacifistas and now Seraphim.</p>
<p>Lunarians seem to have more importance than other races. They &quot;used to live as gods atop the red line&quot;, and the Seraphim look just like them fr.</p>
<p>We should also consider how mechs and robots play into this. Franky is obviously a cyborg, and now we've seen ancient giants like Oars as well as Oars-like giant robots. How much of the ancient kingdom was focused on mechanics, and how much was focused on biology? What is the intersection between these two things in the world of One Piece?</p>
<p>None of these races are significantly different from humans, except for arguably fishmen/merfolk. All of the other races are humans with a single trait changed. Giants are big humans. The three-eyed tribe has three eyes instead of two. Longleg people are just humans with long legs, and same with the longarm tribe.</p>
<p>It's clear that the ancient kingdom had the power to shape reality itself, making large alterations to both living creatures and the world itself. In short, the ancient kingdom's tech is directly responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The red line</li>
<li>The border around Wano, and the entire structure of Wano as a country</li>
<li>All devil fruits</li>
<li>The ancient weapons</li>
<li>The different strange races around the world</li>
</ul>
