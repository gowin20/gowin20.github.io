      <h1>Experimental Engagements</h1>
      <h5>College Scholars Requirement - June 26, 2020</h5>
      My three experimental engagements for this year were <b>Research, Digital Media Practice,</b> and <b>Entrepreneurial / Financial Studies</b>.
      I spent a good amount of time pursuing all three of them.
      <h2 >Research</h2>
      <p>I wanted to &quot;dive deep into how machine learning works,&quot; then apply it to things like &quot;a chess engine, 
        a word creation algorithm, and an art generator&quot;</p>
      <p>While I did not complete the specific projects I discussed back in August, my research still led me to create some amazing things.</p>
      <p>This engagement inspired me to take Linguistics 185a in Winter Quarter, which is the first class on Computational Linguistics. 
        This subject has amazingly useful applications for machine learning.
        <p>Using my knowledge from this class, I was able to make lots of useful linguistic programs. Most notably, 
          I made an algorithm which generates grammatical sentences from a provided set of words. 
          In addition to this, I made another algorithm which uses sentence parsing to check if a provided sentence is grammatical. 
          These algorithms definitely aren&#x27;t going to be used at Google or anything, but I&#x27;m very proud of them! </p>
        <p>
          My next step in this field is to deepen my knowledge of this by recreating the programs in Python, rather than Haskell. 
          I will then be able to use data collection processes to provide the programs with a proper database of words.
        </p>
      <p> In addition to researching Linguistics, I also attacked this engagement from another angle: Data Collection.
        Machine Learning is the process of training a program based off of a dataset which you provide it. 
        This means that a core aspect of machine learning is obtaining datasets to train your algorithm with. 
        I used Python&#x27;s Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from webpages, as well as tons of different APIs,
         in order to obtain information from the backend of websites. 
         Through these data collection methods, I made several programs which analyze data and generate graphical representations. 
         Finally, I later taught this practice to students in my capacity as an instructor at Juni Learning.</p>
         
      
      <h2>Digital Media Practice</h2>
        <p>For this engagement, I wanted to &quot;apply my knowledge of drawing up to this point to create good-looking 2d animations, 
        and incorporate them into a new-and-improved version of my website&quot;
        </p>
      
        <p>To fulfill this engagement, I focused a large amount of energy towards creating a new-and-improved version of my website. 
          That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re reading this now! While it looks simple at first glance, I ended up spending an impressive 
          amount of time creating it - roughly equivalent to a part-time job for about 3 weeks. It went through many iterations 
          before the one you see now. While I have made websites before, this is the most refined one by far, and the one which I&#x27;m
           the most proud of.</p>
        <p>To clarify: I did not use a program like Squarespace or Wix to create this site. 
          I didn&#x27;t even rip other people&#x27;s code off. Everything on this website was designed by me, 
          and written by hand in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The process of creating this required proficiency in 
          several different skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to write and understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to select good-looking color palates (seriously, I spent like half the time selecting colors for each individual page)</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to create a good-looking site layout and theme</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to plan site content, and gather pictures / writing to showcase</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In addition to my website, I have also continued my passion for Digital Media in other ways. 
            While I have not added any animations to my site yet, I am in the process of doing so. 
            Most of my efforts have been in continuing to improve my Photoshop skills. One example piece is on the Art page.</p>
          <p>Finally, I have ended up exploring Digital Media in a way which I was not expecting. 
            I recently got a promotion at work, and have been selected to become one of Juni Learning&#x27;s Blog Writers! 
            This is super exciting, because I absolutely love to write! 
            I&#x27;m ecstatic that the people at Juni recognized my passion. The blog can be found <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/">here</a>. 
            I&#x27;ve written a few articles already, that are due to be published soon!</p>
            
      <h2>Entrepreneurial / Financial Studies</h2>
      <p>My final Experimental Engagement did not go as sucessfully as the first two. 
        While I pursued Financial Studies during my spring quarter, 
        I ultimately did not find enough interest in the subject to continue learning about it.</p>
      <p>My original goal for this engagement was not as concrete as the first two. 
        I stated that &quot;I know that I want to improve my networking skills,
         and apply them as much as possible in order to explore internship/job opportunities. 
         I also stated that I wanted to learn more about how the economy works.</p>
      <p>To pursue this engagement, I first began reading much more about the stock market and the state of the economy in general. 
        I figured that since I don&#x27;t really have any experience in money-related fields, 
        taking an introductory college course would be a great way to start off. 
        Because of this, I enrolled in Economics 1 during week 3 of my Spring quarter.</p>
      <p>At first, I did great in the class! All of the material was intuitive to me, and I even managed to get a perfect 100 on my first midterm. 
        I like to plan ahead, so I even found myself considering a double major in Linguistics &amp; Computer Science and Economics. 
        This plan was especially tempting to me because Economics is one of the shortest majors at UCLA. 
        According to my calculations I could add on the double major and still be on track to graduate in 4 years! 
        I even went as far as planning out my course load with Nol.</p>
        
      <p>However, during the second half of Spring Quarter (which should honestly be referred to as the &quot;First Covid Quarter,&quot; things began to go downhill. 
        I started to struggle with long bouts of sadness and depression, and my productivity began to decline sharply. 
        I found that I was not motivated to continue doing work in my Economics class. Thinking more about it, I realized that Economics in general might just not be that appealing to me. 
        I ended up dropping the class and abandoning my plans to double major, as there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to major in a subject which I&#x27;m not that interested in.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, I still feel as if it&#x27;s necessary for me to have experience in the world of economics in order to pursue my dreams. 
        My new plan is to aim for a minor in Entrepreneurship, which is similar to Economics but should be more up my alley.</p>
      <p>This engagement goes to show a valuable lesson: The things you pursue sometimes don&#x27;t turn out successfully, and that&#x27;s okay. What&#x27;s important is that I put in the effort.</p></div>
