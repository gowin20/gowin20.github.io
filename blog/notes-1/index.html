    <main class="post-content">
            <article><p>I have a lot of post-it notes with art on them. I'm talking <em>a lot</em> a lot; around 1500 in total. My eventual goal is to create a dynamic website allowing you to view and zoom in on high-quality photographs of each note. To realize my vision, I'm going to need to take a ton of pictures.</p>
<p>I want each post-it note to have its own high-resolution image that properly showcases its glory. In order to do this, I'll have to figure out an efficient way to digitize them in bulk. I did some googling and found this great <a href="https://www.scancafe.com/how-to/bulk-scan-photo-collection">article on bulk photo scanning</a> from ScanCafe where they discuss several different methods.</p>
<p>There are several convient professional-grade options that are out of my reach. I could <a href="https://www.scancafe.com/services/photo-scanning">pay a service to scan my photos</a>, but I'm not willing to drop over $700 to digitize my collection. I could purchase a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-FastFoto-FF-680W-Wireless-High-Speed/dp/B07DLX26BB/">bulk photo scanning system</a>, but the price once again clocks in at a minimum of around $600. Ideally I'd like to do this for free, or spend no more than $100 trying.</p>
<p>It seems like my options are thus: Purchase an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Perfection-V39-Document-resolution/dp/B00SSXQ7Q2/">affordable flatbed photo scanner</a> or devise my own ad-hoc method. Of course, I tried the more difficult and creative method first.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent some serious brainpower devising a good system to photograph these notes. I talked to my friends, and together we discussed different setups with accompanying diagrams.</p>
<p>The core idea was to take a photo of each note, or a set of notes in bulk, using a suspended camera and proper lighting. I have a phone with a 64MP camera, which is more than enough power for what I need. For my first attempt, I quickly purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097SS6K9M?psc=1">ring light</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072KNBV21?psc=1">phone mount</a> to mount on my microphone arm. Let's see how this worked.</p>
<p>(image here)</p>
<p>The lighting looks great, and the arm works well enough for my purposes. I set the notes on a black background that's anchored to the table, in order to keep each photo exactly the same. However, there's one serious problem with this setup: bent notes.</p>
<p>(bent notes image)</p>
<p>Not all of my specimens have been treated properly, resulting in many warped edges and bent notes. I need a way to flatten each note to a uniform size. When i first devised this method, my plan was to layer a sheet of plastic over the notes. That worked... not so well!</p>
<p>(reflection image)</p>
<p>you can see the light source clear as day! You can even see my silly little face as well. This won't do at all.</p>
<p>This problem is getting complicated and extemely janky. I should probably just buy a scanner.</p>
<p>This reflection problem turned out to be a much bigger issue than I thought, and I tried several different methods to fix it. I talked to my friend Armin, and he sent me these genius schematics that use suction to flatten the notes:</p>
