      <p>This page serves as an archive for the best of my writing pieces. Currently collected here are papers on mythology, climate change,
        and my family. You can find links to these papers on the left-hand side of the page. My goal with this page is to only post papers that actually contribute to human knowledge,
        and are fascinating reads. Clicking on any of the links to the left will be worth your time!
      </p>
      <p>In addition to these links, this page also contains a short description of each paper. I also have a link to the Juni Learning Blog on the left, which I currently write for.</p>



      <h2>Mythology</h2>
      <p>My papers in mythology were written over the course of my Freshman year at UCLA. I took the GE30 Mythology cluster,
        so mythology was a big focus of my entire first year. For cohesiveness, I spent the bulk of that time analyzing and writing about
        one story / culture. I chose to focus for the most part on Chinese culture and stories. In particular, I wrote about the Great Flood of Gun-Yu.
      </p>
      <h4>The Great Flood of Gun-Yu (大禹治水)</h4>
      <p>This mythical flood story serves as the origin story for almost all of Chinese culture. Drawing striking parrallels to other flood narratives
       in Gilgamesh and the Bible, this story describes the most catastrophic flood to ever happen in China. The rivers rose, and a majority of the land became flooded.
       In addition to this, the water persisted for many years! Great Yu controls the flood by building irrigation systems, and in the process invents Agriculture in China. 
       To recognize his achievements, the people of China name Great Yu Emperor. He goes on to found the Xia Dynasty, which was the first ever dynasty in China (and may or may not actually have existed)
      </p>
      <p>Several of my papers here discuss this myth. In <b>The Foundational Flood Myth of Chinese Culture </b>, I analyze how this great myth
        lays the goundwork for the Chinese dynastic system which would dominate the country for almost 3,000 years. In the direct translation of the original myth,
      many fascinating details are discussed pertaining to the specifics of administering an empire.</p>
      <p>In <b>The Mythical Advent of Chinese Civilization</b>, I discuss how the advent of agriculture in China is explained by this Myth.
      This is especially interesting, because story's theme of the acquisition of a bronze-age civilization stems from the actual social and technological 
      revolutions that took place both when the myth was written and when it is set. This paper goes into deeper historical analysis to provide a proper backdrop for the story.</p>
      <p>Another big part of the course was looking at how myths are pervasive over time, meaning that many stories we tell today are
        modern multiforms of ancient myths. My paper <b>Modern Chinese Flood Myths</b> compares the 2003 movie <i>Still Life</i> to the story of Gun-Yu.
        The movie, pertaining to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in central China, draws upon the ancient myth to great effect. However, there might not be a happy ending in this one...
      </p>
      <p>I wrote several other papers and presentations on Mythology which I decided not to include on this website. The best of these is an awesome presentation
        connecting the show <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> to the classic Chinese myth <i>Journey to the West</i>. There's lots of cool parallels!
      </p>
      <p>In addition to Chinese myths, I also wrote two or three papers on Hungarian mythology. Hungarian oral tradition is especially interesting to me,
        as Hungarian is just about the only language that is not Indo-European. This means that they possess different historical origins from the rest of Europe.
        While Indo-European myths can be mostly homogenous across cultures, I expected Hungarian's Uralic culture to produce radically different myths. What I foudn was
        an unbelievable amalgamation of Indo-European mythology with new myths I had never seen before. Given Hungary's close proximity to the rest of Europe,
        they were influenced by the cultures around them and adopted many facets of their stories. My fascinating paper <b>Hungarian Multiforms of Famous Indo-European Stories</b> explores this further.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Papers</h2>
      <p>Some of my other papers are also worth reading. if you were to read only one paper from this site, I would reccomend that you choose 
        <b>The Exploitation of the Ogallala Aquifer</b>. This aquifer currently provides about 30% of the water used for irrigation in the United States,
        but it is rapidly dwindling and functionally non-renewable. Get educated on this issue and let's fight to make a change!
      </p>
      <p>You can also read about <b>My Parent's Love Story</b>, written as part of some Ethnographic research I did during my first year at college.
      This paper might be more interesting if you have a personal connection to me or my parents.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you have ever struggled with poor mental health and anxiety, I would reccomend reading my paper <b>Using Mental Toughness to Combat Anxiety</b>.
      I have personally struggled with anxiety for as long as I've been alive, and have by no means overcome it. However, I've found a system which helps 
    me manage it and greatly reduce its impact on my life. I talk more about my system in this 15-page research paper.</p>
